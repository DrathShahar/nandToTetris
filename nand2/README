Project 2 - build a set of chips. culminating in the construction of the ALU chip of the Hack cmputer

HalfAdder - Computes the sum of two bits
FullAdder - Computes the sum of three bits
Add16 - Adds two 16-bit values
Inc16 - 16-bit incrementer: out = in + 1 (arithmetic addition)
ALU - Arithmetic-Logic unit
